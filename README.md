Remove middle element of linked list

I assumed some additional requirements while coding this.  They are as follows:

1.  Nil should be returned if the list is nil.
2.  Nil should be returned if the list is not a valid list.
3.  When the list contains only one element, it is not removed.
4.  If the list contains an even number of elements, no element is removed.
5.  The method that removes the middle element from the list returns the updated list.
